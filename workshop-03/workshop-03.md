# Workshop 03: HTML and Bootstrap

# Introduction

Developers write website GUIs using HTML and CSS. As we discussed in
class, these technologies are becoming increasingly difficult to use
directly.  Websites must work across different browsers
(Chrome/Safari/Internet Explorer), operating systems
(Windows/Mac/Linux), and devices (desktop/smartphone/tablet). Managing
this complexity can be quite difficult!

In this class, you will use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to write your
website GUI. Bootstrap provides you with useful HTML and CSS primitives for
writing website GUIs that work across desktop, tablet, and mobile. Wikipedia
summarizes Bootstrap quite well:

> Bootstrap is a free and open-source collection of tools for creating websites
> and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for
> typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well
> as optional JavaScript extensions. It aims to ease the development of dynamic
> websites and web applications.

In this workshop, you will use Bootstrap to write basic, non-interactive website
GUIs. By the end of the workshop, you should have a decent idea of what is
possible using Bootstrap, and how to apply Bootstrap to your group project.

Specifically, you will:

* Learn about HTML
* Learn about CSS
* Learn how to use Bootstrap
* Write the next Facebook in Bootstrap!
  * ...OK, that's an overstatement. We're going to create a rough version of Facebook's layout.

We will not have time to cover the following topics, but we encourage students
to explore them on their own:

* [Responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)
* Compatibility with ancient web browsers (IE8, IE7, etc)
  * These web browsers are [becoming increasingly irrelevant](http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-browser_version_partially_combined-ww-monthly-201412-201512).

# Part 0: Initial setup

To get started you need to fork
the [GitHub repository for this workshop][repo]. To do that click on
the "**Fork**" button, it is on the upper right-hand part of the
github page next to "**Unwatch**" and "**Star**". The repository
contains the version of Bootstrap we will be using (v3.3.6) and a
basic script that runs a local web server:

![Forking the Workshop](../images/fork.png)

Clone the repository into your **class folder**, `cd`, into it, and
run the following command to install a basic web server:

```
npm install
```

This command will create a `node_modules` folder, which you should leave alone.
It contains the web server.

Run the following command to start the local web server, which will let you
view the HTML you produce in a web browser:

```
npm run serve
```

*Note: If you have a firewall installed, you will need to approve Node.js to
open port 8080 on the network. Most firewalls will ask you immediately.*

Navigate your web browser to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/), which should look something like this:

![Server Listing](../images/server-listing.png)

**Keep that console window open for the entirety of the workshop.** When you close that window, the web server stops! Open a second console window and navigate to the workshop git repository directory so you can run other commands while the server runs.

# Part 1: Hello, Bootstrap!

Let's get familiar with Bootstrap by writing a simple "Hello World!" webpage.

This workshop's git repository has the following directories:

* `css/`: A folder to put CSS files into. Currently contains a few Bootstrap CSS
files. You can add new CSS files to this directory, but *do not modify the
Bootstrap CSS files.* We will describe how to customize the look of Bootstrap
the proper way.
* `fonts/`: Bootstrap contains a number of [Glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons)
that you are free to use in your website. The `fonts` directory contains
[web font](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_typography) files containing these
Glyphs. Since Bootstrap works on every browser, it maintains these fonts in
several formats. *Do not modify these files.*
* `img/`: A folder to put your images into.
* `js/`: Contains Bootstrap's JavaScript dependencies.

You will put all HTML files into the root of the repository.

Create the file `helloworld.html` in the root of the repository, and put the
following HTML into it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <!-- The above 3 meta tags *must* come first in the head;
	     any other head content must come *after* these tags -->
    <title>Bootstrap 101 Template</title>

    <!-- Bootstrap's CSS -->
    <link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- All of your HTML will go between here.... -->
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <!-- ...and here. -->
    <!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) -->
    <script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Include all compiled plugins (below),
	     or include individual files as needed -->
    <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You will use this same boilerplate code for all of your Bootstrap projects.

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/helloworld.html, and you should see the
following:

![Hello Bootstrap](../images/hello_bootstrap.png)

**Add `helloworld.html` to Git, commit it, and push to GitHub**


## A walk through `helloworld.html`, aka "what are those tags for?"

*tl;dr: Bootstrap handles all of this stuff so you can focus on making cool websites.*

Most of the HTML here is pretty standard
(e.g. the
[`html` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html),
[`head` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head),
[`body` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body),
etc)...  but some of the elements are confusing. Let's discuss them
now!

The following is
a [document type declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_declaration):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Roughly, these tell the web browser how to interpret the document. The
web has gone through many iterations, and so older documents on the
web are displayed slightly differently than newer ones. This doctype
is
the
[HTML5 doctype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_declaration#HTML5_DTD-less_DOCTYPE),
which is what you should generally use on all of your websites.

The template contains a block of `meta` tags, which are somewhat interesting:

```html
<meta charset="utf-8">
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

The first line tells the browser to interpret the rest of the document
from that point as `utf-8`, which is a character
encoding.
[Character encodings are a rabbit hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding),
but, at a high level, it tells the browser how to translate the
low-level bits of the document into language characters. Without this
tag, the web server would have to tell the browser what character
encoding to use. If it didn't, the web browser would likely assume
ASCII, which means fun emojis like üëç  won't display properly. *tl;dr:
You generally want utf-8 at all times.*

The second line tells Internet Explorer to use its new Edge rendering
engine if available, which is much more standards compliant than its
older rendering engines. On certain versions of IE, this tag is
required to enable new browser features.

The third line is for mobile browsers; it tells the browser to render
the page at the width of the device's screen, and to start the page
view at the standard zoom level. Otherwise, the browser may render the
website with a different width (e.g. thinner or larger), or may use a
different zoom level when it loads your website.

Finally, Bootstrap puts its `script` tags as the last items in the `body` of the
HTML file, which seems unusual if you have ever written HTML before. These tags
pull in the JavaScript files that Bootstrap relies on. We will cover these tags
later when we start covering JavaScript:

```html
<body>
  <!-- snip -->
  <!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) -->
  <script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <!-- Include all compiled plugins (below),
       or include individual files as needed -->
  <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
</body>
```

Most HTML guides specify that `script` tags be added to the `head` of the
document. However, if Bootstrap did that, the web browser would wait until both
`jquery.min.js` and `bootstrap.min.js` downloaded and initialized before
displaying the `body` of the webpage. On a mobile connection, this could
translate into a multi-second wait.

By putting these tags into the `body`, the web browser will display all of the
content in the HTML document *before* the `script` tags while the `script` tags
load. This is now standard practice on most websites.

[There are more modern ways to do this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24070373),
but Bootstrap uses this method because it is compatible with the most web
browsers.

# Part 2: Facebook in Bootstrap

Many of you are likely familiar with Facebook. In this part of the workshop, you
will recreate Facebook's desktop interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
Facebook's desktop interface looks like this:

![Facebook](../images/facebook.png)

**For grading purposes, we are going to have you write git commits at particular
points in the workshop with specific messages.** We will look at your website
at those commits, and check that it is correct. If you do not commit your code
when the guide tells you to, or if you use a different commit message, we will
have trouble grading your submission.

Let's dive in!

## Step 00: Basic Bootstrap template

Create a file called `facebook.html` in the root of the workshop repository with
the standard Bootstrap boilerplate we used for the Hello World example, except
with a modified `title`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <!-- The above 3 meta tags *must* come first in the head;
		 any other head content must come *after* these tags -->
    <title>Facebook</title>

    <!-- Bootstrap's CSS -->
    <link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Our Facebook layout will go here. -->

    <!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) -->
    <script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <!-- Include all compiled plugins (below),
		 or include individual files as needed -->
    <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Don't commit anything to Git just yet; we're going to do a bit more first!

## Step 01: Facebook at the Macro Level

Now that we have a template, it's time to work on the layout of our Facebook
clone! But... Facebook's desktop interface is quite cluttered. You may not know
where to begin.

At this point, it's important to look at the big picture. Ignore the details;
what are the *top-level content panes* on the webpage? If we can create those
properly, then we can start filling in the details of each. HTML
documents are *trees*, so you should be able to edit the content of each
content pane independently.

In other words, if you establish these content panes correctly, the size and
contents of one content pane will not impact the others.

To answer my own question, there are five top-level content panes:

![Facebook Content Panes](../images/facebook_content_panes.png)

Facebook uses a three-column layout, with a top navigation bar and a chat dock
in the corner. What we want to do now is create HTML for each of these using
Bootstrap.

Bootstrap has two primary documentation pages for creating the layout of a
website:

- [CSS Guide](http://getbootstrap.com/css/): Documents many of the CSS classes
available within Bootstrap, which you can use to style / format your GUI.
- [Component Guide](http://getbootstrap.com/components/): Documents the
components/widgets in Bootstrap. The line between *components* and *simple CSS
classes* is murky at best; many components are simply CSS classes you apply to
HTML elements. You'll likely check both of these pages regularly when designing
a website.

We will refer to content in both of these as you build your Facebook clone.

### Basic Navbar

The component guide contains a section on how
to
[create a navigation bar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar),
which is absolutely *perfect* for the Facebook navigation bar.

In your template, add an *empty* Bootstrap navigation bar to the `body` of the
page. It should go *before* the `script` tags:

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-default">
  NAVBAR
</nav>
```

[The `nav` HTML tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav)
is intended for a content pane with links to other parts of the site.
`navbar` and `navbar-default` are Bootstrap CSS classes, which transform the
ordinary HTML tag into a Bootstrap navigation bar. HTML tags can have an
arbitrary number of CSS classes applied to them. Later on, we'll define our
own classes to customize our site further.

Now, if you
refresh
[http://localhost:8080/facebook.html](http://localhost:8080/facebook.html),
you'll see a faint gray outline of a navigation bar:

![Navbar Outline](../images/navbar_outline.png)

You may be tempted to fill in the navbar with buttons and such, and figure out
how to make it Facebook blue... but *do not do that just yet*. When implementing
a webpage layout, the top-level structure of a webpage is the most important
detail to think through and get right. It quickly becomes frustrating if you try
to change/fix the top-level structure of a fully-developed webpage, which
typically contains hundreds of lines of HTML!

### Three Columns

With the navbar in place, we can tackle creating the main three columns.
Bootstrap has a handy [grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid), which
lets you place HTML elements in rows and columns. You will use this grid system
regularly in your layouts.

The grid documentation contains many details, but the most important facts are:

* A grid contains a list of rows.
* Each row has 12 columns.
* Each grid cell can span 1 or more columns, can be specified for a particular
  screen size, and can begin at a particular column.
  * For this tutorial, we are targeting *medium*-size screens, so we will
    only use `col-md-*` CSS classes.
  * Bootstrap lets you make *responsive* designs that adapt to different screen
    sizes. You can define columns that span different numbers of columns for
    different screen sizes, and can define columns that only display for
    particular screen sizes. We will not cover this in this workshop, but
    understanding how this works is crucial for writing mobile websites in
    Bootstrap.
* Each row is as tall as the largest cell within it, and expands to fill the width
  of the HTML element that contains it.
* You can nest grids within grids by defining rows within cells.

We'll cover each of these points (and more!) as we make grids for the Facebook
layout.

For the Facebook three-column layout, we can make one row with three cells:
one for the left sidebar, one for the main feed, and one for the right sidebar.
We just need to decide how many columns each cell spans!

To visualize the solution, here's the Facebook layout with the Bootstrap
grid columns overlaid on top:

![Facebook Grid](../images/facebook_grid.png)

*Remember: The Bootstrap grid system is always 12 columns wide, each
column is equal in size, and the columns expand to fill the width of
the HTML element that contains it.*

The left sidebar is *roughly* 2 columns wide, the feed 7, and the right sidebar 3.
Now, we can add a simple, one-row grid to the `body` of our Facebook clone.
Add this just below the navbar:

```html
<!-- The container for our grid. The outermost grid must be placed within
     a `container` or `container-fluid` class. (Meaning: If you nest a grid
     within a grid, you should not define another `container`)
     What's the difference between these two types of container? There's a
     good answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/a/22263969 -->
<div class="container">
  <!-- The row that contains the three main columns of the website. -->
  <div class="row">
    <!-- Left sidebar: A cell that spans 2 columns -->
    <div class="col-md-2">
      Left Sidebar
    </div>
    <!-- Main feed: A cell that spans 7 columns -->
    <div class="col-md-7">
      Main Feed
    </div>
    <!-- Right sidebar: A cell that spans 3 columns -->
    <div class="col-md-3">
      Right Sidebar
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Now, our Facebook clone looks like the following:

![Facebook Clone](../images/facebook_clone_macro.png)

Those look like the correct proportions!

If you resize your browser window to make it wider or narrower, you'll notice
that the width of the grid changes slightly. [The `container` that we nested
our grid inside has several fixed widths, depending on the width of the
browser window.](http://stackoverflow.com/a/22263969) This is part of
Bootstrap's *responsive design*, which we encourage you to read more about
if you are interested.

Also, note that your Facebook layout looks weird when the browser gets
too thin. We will not address this limitation in this workshop, but there
are two solutions to this problem: 1) [Disabling Bootstrap's responsiveness](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#disable-responsive),
or 2) Adding in extra Bootstrap CSS classes so the layout looks good on smaller screens.

### Chat Popup

The final main content pane on the Facebook page is the chat popup menu. This
menu docks at the bottom of the screen, and sits *on top* of the content on the
right. How can we re-create this popup using Bootstrap?

[The CSS `position` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position)
tells the browser how to render an HTML element and its children (i.e. nested elements).

We can position the chat menu using the `absolute` position, which instructs the
browser to display the element at a specific location relative to the browser
window. To ensure that the chat menu covers contents on the page, we can set the
CSS property [`z-index`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index)
to a large value. Elements with a larger `z-index` always cover elements with
a lower `z-index`.

The next question: How do we tell the browser how wide the chat menu is?
Up until now, all of our HTML elements have a width that is relative to the size
of the browser window. For example, the width of the navigation bar and the main grid depends
on the width of the `container` class, which depends on the size of the browser window. *This is a good thing.* Our layout will
display well on desktop devices with a variety of screen sizes.

Often, new web developers are tempted to micromanage every pixel on their
webpages by defining pixel widths, heights, and offsets on all of their HTML
elements. This is a *bad idea*. HTML layouts produced using this technique are:

* **Unmaintainable**: The HTML/CSS will be cluttered with specific pixel offsets.
  Adding additional content panes or altering the layout would be a
  considerable undertaking, as all of the pixel values affect one another.
* **Inflexible**: Bootstrap is designed so that your webpage can look good on
  many screen sizes. Using specific pixel counts restricts your webpage to
  looking good on only one screen size.
* **Non-portable**: Web browsers differ slightly in how they display webpages.
  It's common that one browser will add a single extra pixel of padding
  between elements over another browser due to a [rounding error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error).
  You cannot count on pixel-precise behavior across browsers.

However, there are exceptions to every rule. The chat menu is a *small* floating
menu, and its contents do not vary much in width. In particular, it contains a
fixed-width online indicator, text indicating how many people are online (which
will be at most 8 + log 10(# online friends) characters wide), and two
fixed-width buttons. We cannot rely on this content being a specific width,
but we can reasonably assume that it won't exceed a certain width.

The Facebook chat popup itself is ~300 pixels wide, which gives the content
plenty of room to grow if the person has many friends online:

![Facebook Chat Menu](../images/facebook_chat_menu.png)

With that discussion out of the way, we're going to add a `div` element for the
chat menu to the HTML. Before we can do that, however, we need to add a CSS
file so we can define custom CSS stylings for our website.

Create an empty file at `css/facebook.css`, and add the following HTML to
`facebook.html` within the `head` tag, just after the `link` tag for
`bootstrap.min.css`:

```css
<!-- Custom CSS -->
<link href="css/facebook.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Now, our webpage will load and apply `facebook.css` when you view it.

Open `facebook.css`, and add a CSS rule for the chat menu:

```css
.chat-popup {
  width: 300px;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0px;
  right: 20px;
}
```

*Note: CSS classes typically use all lowercase letters with dashes
in-between words. You don't need to follow this convention, but the
rest of the web typically does.*

The above is a *CSS rule*. A *CSS rule* contains a *selector* and a *declaration
block*. The syntax is as follows:

```css
SELECTOR {
  DECLARATION BLOCK
}
```

Our rule uses a [CSS class selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors),
which means "apply these properties to elements with the class `chat-popup`".
Class selectors are written using a period (`.`) before the target class.

CSS rules can change the look and position of elements on the webpage, and are
how Bootstrap components work. The CSS rule above is only concerned with the
*position* of the chat menu. The value for `bottom` and `right`, when `position`
is set to `fixed`, means:
"Display this element 0 pixels from the bottom, and 30 pixels from the right".

Add the following HTML to the `body` of your page, after the `container` div
containing the grid:

```html
<div class="chat-popup">
  CHAT MENU
</div>
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/facebook.html, and you should see the
following:

![Facebook Clone Chat Menu](../images/facebook_clone_chat_menu.png)

That looks about right!

**`add` `facebook.html` and `css/facebook.css` to Git, `commit` your
changes with the commit message `fb1`, and `push` the changes to
GitHub.**

## Step 02: Scrolling Behavior

Next, we need to check how our layout responds when we have enough content
to trigger scrolling. On Facebook, the main feed is larger than the browser
window's height. The user scrolls down the feed to see content hiding
off-screen. As the user does this, the chat menu and top menu follows along.

*Note: Facebook also makes the right sidebar follow as you scroll so you look
at trending content and advertisements, but it scrolls in an odd manner. We
will not cover this behavior in this workshop. Our right sidebar will not
"stick" to the side of the browser window.*

Let's see how our current layout responds to content in the main feed.
Add a *really tall* `div` element to the main feed's `div`, like so:

```html
<div class="col-md-7">
  Main Feed
  <div style="height: 99999px;">

  </div>
</div>
```

The `style` attribute can be specified on any HTML element. It lets you specify
CSS stylings within the HTML. You should avoid using the `style` attribute,
as it clutters your HTML with styling information. You should use HTML to
organize the structure of your webpage (i.e. the HTML tree), and CSS to
customize the look given that structure.

In this example, we are adding this element *temporarily* to investigate
scrolling behavior, so we are justified in using `style`.

Navigate
to
[http://localhost:8080/facebook.html](http://localhost:8080/facebook.html) and
try scrolling... and...  you'll discover there are some problems:

![Facebook Lone Scroll Issue](../images/facebook_clone_scroll_issue.png)

The chat menu and navigation bar should stay "attached" to the browser window
as you scroll, but they don't. Why is that?

### Chat Menu

We used `position: absolute;` to place the menu, which places the menu relative
to the browser window. However, the menu does not stay in place when you scroll!
(It does, however, stay in place when you resize the window to make it longer.
Weird, right?)

Instead, we need to use `position: fixed;`, which *fixes* the element relative
to the user's current view of the webpage. Fix the CSS for the `chat-popup`
class, and reload the page:

![Facebook Clone Chat Menu Scroll Fixed](../images/facebook_clone_chat_menu_scroll_fixed.gif)

Much better!

The [link we posted earlier](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position)
mentions these differences, but it's much easier to understand when you see it
in-person. (Also, full disclosure: we made this mistake ourselves when creating
this assignment.)

### Navigation Menu

Considering the chat menu solution, you may be tempted to make the `nav` element
absolutely placed, and call it a day. You can certainly fix the problem that
way, but it's much easier to use [Bootstrap's built-in CSS class that does it
for you](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-fixed-top).

Add the `navbar-fixed-top` CSS class to your `nav` element, and reload the page.
The navigation bar is now docked at the top... but it's also covering the three
main columns!

![Facebook Clone Navbar](../images/facebook_clone_navbar_covering.png)

To fix this, we can simply *offset* the content of the `body` by a particular
pixel amount. Add the following to `facebook.css`:

```css
body {
  padding-top: 60px;
}
```

This CSS rule uses a [*type selector*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors),
which applies the rule to all elements of the specified type.
This particular CSS rule applies its properties to *every `body` element on the
webpage*. Now, the browser will add 60 pixels worth of padding above the `body`
element. Since the navbar and chat content panels are placed relative
to the browser's viewport (effectively *floating* above the webpage), they are
not impacted by this change.

We chose 60 pixels for the offset because the
[Bootstrap example code for a fixed navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#examples-navbars)
uses a similar value. The navbar is apparently ~50 pixels high by default, and
we can rely on this value remaining constant.

Now, all is well!

![Facebook Clone Scrolling](../images/facebook_clone_scrolling_ok.png)

**`commit` your changes with the commit message `fb2`, and `push` the changes to GitHub.**

## Step 03: The Navigation Bar

With a solid page structure in place, we can start adding buttons and content
to flesh out the layout.

Facebook's navigation bar looks like the following:

![Facebook Navbar](../images/facebook_navbar.png)

Notice that one half of the navigation bar is *left-aligned* (the logo + search
box), and the other half is *right-aligned*, with empty space pooling in the
middle.

Bootstrap's [default example for a navigation bar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-default)
uses the same basic design. We can repurpose this
sample code to imitate Facebook's navigation bar. In addition, we can use
Bootstrap's [Glyphicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons)
to imitate all of Facebook's icons.

First, let's empty out the sample code from that link into its essentials, and
modify it to use a "home" glyphicon for the brand logo:

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-fixed-top navbar-default">
  <!-- ".container-fluid" expands to fill the entire browser view's width.
       ".container" will use the same width as the ".container" in the body,
       which contains the three columns of content.

       We want ".container" here so the navbar is the same width as the content.

       Confused? Try switching between the two container classes once you have a
       complete navbar to see the difference. -->
  <div class="container">
    <!-- This code is only active when viewing the site on mobile. We will not
         cover responsive design, but we'll leave this in, as it's part of the
         example code.-->
    <div class="navbar-header">
      <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse"
		      data-target="#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1" aria-expanded="false">
        <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
      <!-- Use a "home" glyphicon as a logo. -->
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">
        <!-- This is how you display a glyphicon. -->
        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-home"></span>
      </a>
    </div>

    <!-- On mobile, this div is hidden by default. The user hits the button
         in the `navbar-header` to see the content of the div.
         On desktop, this div is visible all of the time. -->
    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="bs-example-navbar-collapse-1">
      <form class="navbar-form navbar-left" role="search">
        <!-- Left-aligned items. -->
      </form>
      <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
        <!-- Right-aligned items. -->
      </ul>
    </div><!-- /.navbar-collapse -->
  </div><!-- /.container -->
</nav>
```

Now, your navigation bar will have a house icon in the corner, instead of the
Facebook logo.

Next, let's add in the search bar. The example code already had one in there,
but it didn't look quite right. [Bootstrap's documentation has an example
input field with an attached button](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#input-groups-buttons).
We can use this code, and modify the button to display the "search" Glyphicon.

Modify the `form` element to include the search bar:

```html
<form class="navbar-form navbar-left" role="search">
  <!-- Left-aligned items. -->
  <div class="input-group">
    <input type="text" class="form-control" placeholder="Search Facebook">
    <span class="input-group-btn">
      <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default">
        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search"></span>
      </button>
    </span>
  </div>
</form>
```

Next, the right-hand side of the navigation bar has 7 different buttons spread
among 4 button groups (the picture + name are a single button). The final button
is a dropdown.

[Bootstrap has support for button groups](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-groups-single),
including [various types of dropdown buttons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-dropdowns-single)
and putting [multiple button groups into a single toolbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-groups-toolbar).
We can use the sample code from the Bootstrap guide to craft the buttons we need.

The original navbar example code used a `ul` element for the right hand side
of the navbar, which is an *unordered list*. Typically, `ul` is used to make
bulleted lists. Modern websites abuse it to place many different HTML elements
side-by-side, since you can eliminate the bullet point and change the behavior
of `ul` via CSS.

`ul` is not an appropriate element for the right-hand-side of our navigation
bar, since we'll be using a button toolbar to group things together.

Change the `ul` element above into a `div`, like so:

```html
<div class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
  <!-- Right-aligned items -->
  <div class="btn-toolbar pull-right" role="toolbar">
    <div class="btn-group" role="group">
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">
        John
      </button>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-group" role="group">
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">
        Home
      </button>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-group" role="group">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">
          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span>
        </button>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">
          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></span>
        </button>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">
          <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span>
        </button>
    </div>
    <div class="btn-group" role="group">
      <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">
        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-lock"></span>
      </button>
      <div class="btn-group" role="group">
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-default dropdown-toggle"
			    data-toggle="dropdown">
          <span class="caret"></span>
        </button>
        <ul class="dropdown-menu">
          <li><a href="#">Log out...</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Notice that the above HTML is entirely composed of Bootstrap sample code. All we
did was replace the text of the buttons with different text or a Glyphicon.

Now if you look at the navbar, it'll look mostly right... but there's an issue
with how the buttons display! They are bunched up toward the top of the screen:

![Facebook Clone Button Issue](../images/facebook_clone_button_issue.png)

Ideally, we'd like these to be vertically aligned within the navbar. The
Bootstrap documentation [discusses this issue](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-buttons),
and has a solution:

> Add the `.navbar-btn` class to `<button>` elements not residing in a `<form>`
> to vertically center them in the navbar.

Apply this fix to *every `button` element in the navbar* (except for the search
  button -- since that's within a `form`!), and the navbar will look as you'd expect:

![Facebook Clone Button Fixed](../images/facebook_clone_button_fixed.png)

When you get a notification, friend request, or message, Facebook adds a number
beside the appropriate button in the navigation bar. Bootstrap supports this
functionality; [it calls these numbers "badges"](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#badges).

Add badges to the notification, friend request, and message buttons:

```html
<div class="btn-group" role="group">
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span>
    <span class="badge">5</span>
  </button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></span>
    <span class="badge">1</span>
  </button>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-globe"></span>
    <span class="badge">3</span>
  </button>
</div>
```

Next, the search bar is a little too small. Facebook uses a 395px wide search
bar. We can create a CSS class for the search bar, and make it 395 pixels wide.

Add the following to `facebook.css`:

```css
.fb-search {
  width: 395px;
}
```

Add the `fb-search` class to the `input` tag for the search bar and... it
doesn't do anything! Why is this?

If you are using Google Chrome, you can right-click the search bar, and click on
*Inspect* to open up Chrome's developer tools. It will show you that Chrome
is ignoring our `width` setting, since it is set already in the Bootstrap
class `form-control`:

![Facebook Search Size Failure](../images/facebook_search_size_increase_fail.png)

We can tell the web browser to make `fb-search`'s `width` setting override
`form-control`'s by marking it `!important`. Using `!important` is
generally not recommended, as it makes your CSS hard to debug, but sometimes it
cannot be avoided. In this case, we do not want to modify Bootstrap, yet we want
to change its behavior for this one case.

You use `!important` on individual properties, like so:

```css
.fb-search {
  width: 395px !important;
}
```

Now, your navigation bar should look like the following:

![Facebook Clone Navbar Badges](../images/facebook_clone_navbar_badges.png)

The navbar is now complete! Later, we'll revisit the navbar to make it look more
like Facebook.
